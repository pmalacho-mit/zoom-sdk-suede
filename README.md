Now that you have a git repository that will behave as a [suede dependency](https://github.com/pmalacho-mit/suede), please perform the following tasks to complete the setup:

# TODO

- [ ] Set Actions permissions (_⚙️ Settings > ▶️ Actions > General > Workflow permissions_)

  - [ ] Read and write permissions
  - [ ] Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests
- [ ] _OPTIONAL (RECOMMENDED):_ Configure pull request head branches to automatically delete (_⚙️ Settings > ⚙️ General > Pull Requests_)

  - This is helpful to keep the branch list clean, as [one of the included github actions](https://github.com/pmalacho-mit/suede-dependency-template/blob/dist/.github/workflows/subrepo-pull-into-main.yml) automatically creates "chore" pull requests
- [ ] Dispatch initialization workflow (_▶️ Actions > Initialization procedure > Run Workflow_)

  - The action will:
    1. Clone a subrepo of the `dist` branch into the `./dist` folder within the `main` branch (so that changes within the `./dist` folder of the `main` branch can be automatically synced to the `dist` branch via [.github/workflows/subrepo-push-dist.yml](https://github.com/pmalacho-mit/suede-dependency-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/subrepo-push-dist.yml))
    2. Replaces the content of this README with specifics around installing this repository as a subrepo dependency
    3. 💥<em>SELF-DESTRUCT</em>💥 (meaning it will delete [.github/workflows/initialize.yml](https://github.com/pmalacho-mit/suede-dependency-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/initialize.yml))
